This is my gmail clone project, created with ReactJS, Redux, ReactRouter, Firebase and Material-UI. Authentication is provided by firebase, using google auth. When you log in you are able to see your mail feed, which is pulled from firebase db. You can dive into each mail and see details. Also composing new email is working via react-hook-form lib.
